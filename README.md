This mod is aiming at making the wolfes in Vintage Story tameable and useful companions to the player.

To tame a wolf, you need to give a bone to a wolf pup and thereby initiate the taming process.</br>
Afterwards, the wolf needs to be fed regularly to be tamed into a dog. Usable food items are raw meat and bones.

Once a wolf is tamed, you can sprint right click on it to access an interface listing various available commands.</br>
You can also right click on it with a pet accessory to make im look more dapper.
